For milestone 3:
1. The site uses media query, the navbar collapses on smaller screens.
2. This has been done.
3. This has been done; the user data is stored when settings requirements and recieving a schedule.
4. This is partially complete. The form submission does not use enough input types.
5. This requirement has been met. The user can edit their requirements.
6. This requirement has been met, the user can download their data.
7. This requirement has been met (mostly), the user can reset their data.
8. This has not been met.
9. This has not been met.

For milestone 2:
1. This is the url to our github repo which is shared with each other and the prof: https://github.com/343-F24-Shrestha/343f24final-jmusp
2. This is the url to our deployed application where anyone could try our app: https://343-f24-shrestha.github.io/343f24final-jmusp/
3. This is the report.html page
4. For example, on https://343-f24-shrestha.github.io/343f24final-jmusp/schedulepreview.html the nav bar collpases on small screens
5. We have 6 pages: Index, help, schedulepreview, signin, and welcome.
6. Each page handles this slightly differently.
7. There is a nav bar on most pages, and sign in doesn't have one but does lead to the home when you sign in.
8. Images have alt attributes.
9. Validates without warnings
10. For example the nav and body are usually different.
11. The sign in page is a form, and it looks good
12. We do not have this complete yet, as there aren't relavent sites to link to, but later it should link to some JMU related sites and potentially credits.
13. Our whole project will be revolving around network requests, as it should be interfacing with APIs to get the classes and rate my professor scores.
