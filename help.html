            <h2 class="header">How does the James Madison University Schedule Planner work?</h2>
            <p>Once signed in, the Home page is your starting point for customizing your class schedule. Here, you can
                set your
                schedule requirements, reset all entered data to start fresh, or import existing data from a JSON file.
                These options
                provide a streamlined way to tailor your schedule creation process to your specific needs.</p>

            <p>From the Home page you'll find the Professor's name and their corresponding rating from RateMyProfessor,
                the days and times for the offerings, and the section numbers.
            </p>

            <p>The Schedule Preview page gives you a comprehensive view of your generated schedule. Organized across the
                days of the
                week, it allows you to see how your selected classes fit into your overall timetable. This feature
                ensures clarity and
                helps you visualize your week at a glance, making it easy to plan your time effectively.</p>

            <h2 class="header">Will this automatically update my schedule on MyMadison?</h2>

            <p>The JMU Schedule Planner doesnâ€™t automatically update sections; students must manually input schedules
                into MyMadison.
                However, it streamlines schedule creation, offering quick, flexible, and customizable options for
                planning and
                reviewing.
            </p>

            <p>You can navigate to MyMadison by clicking this <a href="https://mymadison.jmu.edu/"
                    target="_blank">link</a> to update
                your schedule.
            </p>

            <h3 class="lower-header">Commonly asked Questions:</h3>

            <p><strong>Do I need to sign in to use the planner? </strong></p>

            <p>Unfortunately, you cannot use your MyMadison account to sign in, but you can sign in with Google or
                create an account with us to access the site. A preview is available for those interested in viewing.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Is the planner updated with real-time class availability?</strong></p>

            <p>Yes, the service is updated automatically using real time data on courses currently available at JMU,
                making our program extremely accurate and highly adaptable.</p>

            <p><strong>Can I save multiple schedule versions?</strong></p>

            <p>Users can download their data to view independent of the site and clear their data on the site to start
                again with a new schedule as needed.</p>

            <p><strong>How does the system choose the best schedule for me?</strong></p>
            <p>Our application takes the highest available Professor with a given combination of schedules in the time
                frame asked for to create a schedule that suits the students needs. Factors considered are simply the
                time, rating, and classes needed.</p>

            <p><strong>How does the system choose the best schedule for me?</strong></p>
            <p>Schedules can be edited as they are created.</p>

            <p>Additional tools, such as automatic email alerts for class section availability, automating restrictions
                like prerequisites, and increased ease of use are in the works. For questions pertaining to course
                selections or availabilities themselves, see James Madison University's website or speak with an
                advisor.</p>
